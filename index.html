        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I hold a master's degree in Computer Science Engineering, Linux and FOSS enthusiast, 
            and am deeply committed to personal growth and making a positive impact on the world. 
            My aspiration is to become a computer scientist and leverage technology to create meaningful change.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started my coding journey with Python, which served as my introduction to the world of programming 
            and Deep Learning. I built a chatbot in the year 2020-2021, before the GEN AI era, which was based on BERT 
            and Longformer and capable of retrieving information from sources like Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo, and custom datasets. 
            This project also formed the basis of my B.E Project. It was a significant improvement in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later on, I got into the hallucination of the startup world, specifically with Bloom, where I worked on various startup 
            challenges. During this time, I learned Java for mobile application development. Simultaneously, I started my M.E in CSE.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was during this phase that I got deeply involved in the world of Web3.0. I was amazed with the concepts of cryptocurrency, 
            NFTs and blockchain technologies. I started developing a range of Web3.0 products with my team, including a fully functional 
            Account Abstraction Wallet <a href="https://dvault.site/">Dvault</a>, and a Supply Chain Management system 
            <a href="https://app.contrackts.net">Contrackts</a>. Finally built my version of the web3 newsletter 
            <a href="https://jsncrypts.vercel.app/">JSNcrypts</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the road to startup success was not without its challenges. Despite our efforts, we faced difficulties in bringing 
            our products to the market, and I had to put my startup dreams on hold.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had built Proof Of Knowledge On Chain web3 protocol for knowledge Management system with Multi Sig 
            <a href="https://github.com/PandiaJason/Non-Transferable-Non-Fungible-Tokens">POKOC</a> as my M.E project. 
            Throughout the past six years, my primary struggle has been understanding the fundamental concepts of computer science 
            and mathematics. I went from learning Go language for a month to time-traveling back to 
            <a href="https://github.com/PandiaJason/KR_C">K&R C</a>. Although I had encountered C in my academics, diving into 
            it after working with more abstracted languages like Python, Java, various JavaScript frameworks, and Solidity, gave me 
            the apple of eden for the foundational concepts of computer science. C is where the true essence of computer science unfolds, 
            and it's a place where one can also explore assembly language alongside C.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the love-hate relationship with other abstracted languages and frameworks, I like Flutter. I am determined to enhance 
            my knowledge of computer science, which will allow me to expand into the world of Flutter development. My goal is to contribute 
            to optimized computing and decentralized networking, thereby unleashing the full extent of my potential.
        </p>
